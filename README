NAME
       backup.sh − synchronize files and filder to external USB disk or remote
       rsync server via ssh


SYNOPSIS
       backup.sh is a shell script for backing  up  folders  and  files  using
       rsync or external USB drive.


DESCRIPTION
       backup  reads  the  backup.conf, backup.include and backup.exclude text
       files and then syncronizes folders and files acording those  configura‐
       tion text files.


OPTIONS
       You  can configure the behaviour via text files. This config files are:
       "backup.conf" ‐‐> General configuration file  with  backup  destination
       definition.   INCLUDE ("include.txt") ‐‐> Includes the files and foldes
       to be synched.  EXCLUDE ("exclude.txt")  ‐‐>  Includes  the  files  you
       don’t want to be synched.
       The config file should be saved in the same folder where the script is.


EXAMPLE
       An  example  of execution (after configuration files are done) is quite
       simple: "sh backup.sh".  This backup can be added to the cron in  order
       to make if automatic.
